This is a learning project for me. There will most likely be no complete or final version of the OS. The purpose of the project is for me to better understand assembly, bootstrap and kernel development, and the inner workings of computers.

However, if you are really that interested in seeing DevOS in action, no pun intended ("inaction" heh.), follow the steps below.

COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION (On linux):
1. Download repository
2. READ OVER THE MAKEFILE. Ensure that dd is copying to the right device. The makefile is designed to install DevOS on a usb flash drive located at /dev/sdb. MAKE SURE YOU CHANGE IT TO MATCH YOUR SET-UP. Improper use of dd can result in make happily replacing your entire hard disk with DevOS.
3. Alternatively, run in bochs (see below)

Compilation:
1. Run 'make'. This will compile the binaries.
2. If using bochs, subsequently run 'make img'. This will make a virtual floppy image for bochs to use

Installation on physical media:
1. Open up the makefile, and find the target 'disk'
2. Replace /dev/sdb with the mount point of your media
3. DOUBLE-CHECK THE COMMANDS AND MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. dd will happily overwrite your main partition if you're not careful

NOTE: DevOS is not functional, and as of now, does not even work properly.

DISCLAIMER: DevOS comes with absolutely no guarantee. It quite possibly may end up destroying your computer if installed incorrectly. Even if installed correctly, it is possible that DevOS can corrupt data or even damage hardware.
